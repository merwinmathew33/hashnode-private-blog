# My  First  Taste  Of  Markdown

I am an engineering student who has tried various tools and programming languages during the first 2 years of my college life. But I am not permanent in one field. My interest kept on fluctuating. First I tried web development, then blockchain, cloud, etc. After watching a youtube video I started trying to contribute to open-source projects. But seeing a large codebase decreased my confidence. So after a lot of research, I understood that trying to do simple projects like editing documentation would help me to increase my confidence and motivate me to contribute more and become one among them.

**MARKDOWN** is a simple yet powerful formatting language. You can use markdown to format our text in many different ways. It is easy to learn and use.

First, I created a readme file for my repository [shop cart](https://github.com/merwinmathew33/shoppingcart/edit/main/README.md). I tried to use all kinds of formats in it. Then I wrote a blog in hash node Neptune.

It is amazing. Now I got the confidence to write more blogs regarding my developer journey.
