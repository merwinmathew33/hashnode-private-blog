# Docker :A Deep Dive

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image to use for the build, as well as any dependencies, libraries, or other software needed for the image. The syntax for writing a Dockerfile is very simple, and it consists of a series of commands followed by arguments. Here is an example of a simple Dockerfile:

```apache
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

COPY . /app

WORKDIR /app

CMD ["python3", "main.py"]
```

This Dockerfile specifies that it is based on the `ubuntu:20.04` image and it installs Python 3 as a dependency. It then copies the current directory (`.`) into the `/app` directory in the image, sets that as the working directory and runs the [`main.py`](http://main.py) script when the image is run.

### Docker image

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.

Docker images are built from Dockerfiles, which are simple text files that contain the instructions for building the image. The instructions can include commands to install dependencies, copy files, set environment variables, and more.

To create a Docker image, use the `docker build` command to build the image from the Dockerfile. For example:

```apache
docker build -t my-image 
```

This will build an image named `my-image` from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).

Docker images are stored in a registry, which is a central repository of images. There are public registries, such as Docker Hub, that you can use to share your images with others, and private registries that you can use to store images within your own organization.

### Docker container

Once you have built an image, you can use the `docker run` command to run it as a container. A container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is an isolated environment that runs on top of the host operating system but allows you to package your application and its dependencies in a single, portable unit.For example:

```apache
docker run my-image
```

This will run the `my-image` image as a container.

You can also specify additional options when running a container. For example, you can specify the port to expose, the environment variables to set, and the command to run when the container starts.

For example:

```apache
docker run -p 8080:80 -e ENV_VAR=value -it my-image /bin/bash
```

This will run the `my-image` image as a container, expose port 80 on the host as port 8080 on the container, set the `ENV_VAR` environment variable to `value`, and run the `/bin/bash` command when the container starts.

Once you have started a container, you can use the `docker stop` command to stop it, and the `docker start` command to start it again. You can also use the `docker exec` command to run additional commands inside a running container.

### Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for building, storing, and distributing Docker images. It is the default registry from which to pull images, and it provides public and private repositories for storing and sharing Docker images. Docker Hub is free to use for public repositories, and it provides a range of paid plans for private repositories and additional features.

To use Docker Hub, you first need to create an account and sign in. Once you are signed in, you can create a repository and push an image to it using the `docker push` command.

For example:

```apache
docker push my-image:latest
```

This will push the `my-image` image with the `latest` tag to your Docker Hub repository.

if your image is named `my-image` and you want to push it to a repository named `my-repo`, you can use the following command:

```apache
docker push my-repo/my-image:latest
```

This will push the `my-image` image with the `latest` tag to the `my-repo` repository on Docker Hub.

You can also specify a different tag for your image, such as `v1.0`, by replacing `latest` with the desired tag.

```apache
docker push my-repo/my-image:v1.0
```

You can also use Docker Hub to build images automatically from a GitHub or GitLab repository. This is called "Automated Builds", and it allows you to build an image every time you push a change to your repository. To set up an Automated Build, you need to link your Docker Hub account to your GitHub or GitLab account, and then create a repository on Docker Hub and configure the build settings. Once you have set up an Automated Build, every time you push a change to your repository, Docker Hub will automatically build an image and push it to your repository.
